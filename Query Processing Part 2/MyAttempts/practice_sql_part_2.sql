    Our shelter has been experiencing financial difficulties.
    !!! PLEASE consider donating to your local animal shelter !!!
    The board of directors decided to explore additional revenue sources and came up with an idea.
    Instead of spaying and neutering all animals, the shelter should consider responsible breeding of purebred animals.
    !!!	This is a hypothetical question â€“ ALWAYS spay and neuter your pets !!! 

    Your challenge is to figure out which animals are breeding candidates.
